# Restaurant-Order-Analysis-SQL-Project
This project analyzes customer behavior at Taste of the World Café, a restaurant with a diverse menu. Using SQL, I explored two datasets: Menu Items and Order Details, and combined them to uncover insights about menu performance and customer preferences.

## Goals
- Explore the Menu Items table to understand pricing and category trends.
- Explore the Order Details table to figure out how many orders were made, how big they were, and when they happened.
- Combine both tables to see how customers are reacting to different menu items.
- Share insights that could help the café improve the menu and marketing strategies.

## Tools
- MySQL
- MySQL Workbench

  # Key Takeaways
- The most expensive and least expensive items were easily identified.
- Italian dishes stood out as some of the most popular items.
- A few menu items brought in most of the revenue, showing where the café should focus.
- Top-spending customers often placed large orders with multiple Italian dishes, which could be an opportunity for targeted promotions or bundle deals.
